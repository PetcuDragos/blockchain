    <p>This is cryptomarket. Here you can buy assets like skins/loot/consumables that are unique from any game that posts here the item.
    <p>Games like CS:GO, League of Legends, or many more can sell on this blockchain their unique assets.
    <p>The cool part is that you can buy these assets, use them, and even resell them.
    <p>A new feature that we will implement is a bidding process for these items.
    <p>I hope you will be having a great time.
